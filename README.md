# Sundar-Industrial-Estate
Sundar Industrial Estate comprising of 1750 acres of land was inaugurated in Feb, 2007 and is a vision turned into reality. 
It is the first project assigned to PIE & was envisioned to be an ‘island of facilitation in the sea of harassment’ for prospective industrialists.

The objective was to develop an industrial estate where issues of industrialists are handled and problems solved through ‘One Window’ operation.

There are more than 450 factories in production (as of June 15, 2016) and more than two hundred are expected to join in production within the next year.
